We have built this CRC program, using Python.
We have also implemented GUI, not only because we want a bonus, but also because it is very interesting to have a GUI.
Having a GUI makes your application easy to use.
Who wants to look at a black screen? Who likes a console application!
All of us have contrinuted to making this application.
Best wishes.
